## About The Project

In this project I developed the Blackjack game using Python

## Built With
   - Python
   - IntelliJ
   
## How To Play

Just Git clone this project and run `python blackjack.py` or click on BlackJack.exe

## Rules

<p>Both you and the dealer start with 2 cards each but you can only see the dealer's first card.</p>
<p>You have the option to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly).</p>
<p>Once your turn is over is the dealer's turn. The dealer's face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, a card must be taken. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring the total to 17 or more (but not over 21), the dealer must count the ace as 11 and stand.
</p>

### Cards Value
  - Ace - 1 or 11
  - Face cards(Joker, Queen, King) - 10
  - Others - its pip value.
